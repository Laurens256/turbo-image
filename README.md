# TurboImage

[TurboImage](https://turbo-image.vercel.app//) is a client-side image conversion tool. It allows users to convert images directly in their browser with support for the most common image formats.

## Features

- **Customizable batch size:** Process multiple images at once. A higher batch size will increase RAM usage.
- **Lossy compression settings:** File formats that support lossy compression such as JPEG and WebP can be compressed to reduce file size, at the cost of image quality.

## FAQ

_Q: Why are so few output formats supported?_
<br>
A: TurboImage runs completely in your browser! This means that the supported output formats depend on the browser's capabilities. Most modern browsers support at least JPEG, PNG, and WebP.

_Q: Why would I want to convert images in my browser?_
<br>
A: Often, converting images on your local machine is way faster than uploading them to a server to be converted. Also, it's free to host :)
